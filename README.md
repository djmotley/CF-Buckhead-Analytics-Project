   - Examine trends in attendance, performance, and retention.  
   - Identify high-traffic times and underutilized classes.  

3. **Visualization & Insights**  
   - Create charts showing class popularity, retention by month, and coach utilization.  
   - Correlate engagement with membership duration and performance progression.  

4. **Recommendations**  
   - Suggest optimal scheduling based on attendance heatmaps.  
   - Highlight factors that drive member longevity and satisfaction.
