# CrossFit Buckhead Retention Analytics

Using data to proactively identify at-risk members and improve retention.

---

## Overview

This project delivers a complete analytics pipeline and interactive dashboard that helps **CrossFit Buckhead** understand and reduce member churn. The system consolidates attendance, cancellation, membership, and retail purchase data to:
- Spot early signs of disengagement
- Generate member-level churn risk scores
- Surface high-priority outreach opportunities

The end-to-end workflow transforms raw inputs into cleaned datasets, engineered features, churn risk scores, and a dashboard you can explore with Streamlit.

## Pipeline Workflow

1. **Data Preparation (`data_prep.py`)**
   Loads CSV exports, standardizes formats, and creates unified member views.
2. **Feature Engineering (`feature_engineering.py`)**
   Builds behavioral metrics such as days since last check-in, attendance momentum, retail cadence, and cancellation flags.
3. **Risk Scoring (`risk_scoring.py`)**
   Applies a weighted formula to produce churn risk scores (0–100) and tags members:
   - **Green:** Low risk
   - **Yellow:** Moderate risk
   - **Red:** High risk
   Outputs are written to `data/processed/` and outreach lists to `reports/outreach/`.
4. **Dashboard (`dashboard.py`)**
   Streamlit app that summarizes the latest results with metrics, histograms, boxplots, and top at-risk members. Users can rerun the latest analysis and browse historical score files.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (`pip install -e .` from the project root).
2. Place new data exports inside `data/raw_sample_dylan/` (or adjust paths in `config.py`).
3. Run the pipeline scripts in order:
   ```bash
   python src/cf_buckhead_analytics/data_prep.py
   python src/cf_buckhead_analytics/feature_engineering.py
   python src/cf_buckhead_analytics/risk_scoring.py
   ```

---

## Run the Dashboard

Launch the Streamlit app to explore the latest outputs:

```bash
streamlit run src/cf_buckhead_analytics/dashboard.py
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501` to view live metrics, charts, and outreach tables powered by the data in `data/processed/`.

## Key Insights Demonstrated

- Data engineering with Pandas and modular Python scripts
- Feature design for predictive analytics use cases
- Weight-based churn scoring tailored to boutique fitness
- Visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Web app deployment via Streamlit
- Clean project organization and version control with Git/GitHub

---

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate real-time PushPress API data
- Incorporate class attendance streaks or PR tracking as behavioral features
- Experiment with machine learning models for predictive scoring
- Automate weekly refreshes with cron jobs or GitHub Actions
